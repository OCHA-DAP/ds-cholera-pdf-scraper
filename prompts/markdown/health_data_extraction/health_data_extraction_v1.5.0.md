# System Prompt

You are a data extraction expert specializing in health emergency data from WHO surveillance bulletins. You will receive structured intermediate data (CSV format or structured text) that has been extracted from a PDF by a preprocessing step. Your task is to convert this intermediate data into the final standardized JSON format.

# User Prompt Template

Please standardize and clean the following JSON data that was extracted from a WHO Weekly Bulletin on Outbreaks and Other Emergencies table. 

The data contains surveillance records but may have inconsistent field names, formatting, or data types. Your task is to standardize this into the final schema.

RAW JSON DATA:
{text_content}

Clean and standardize this data into a proper JSON array. Tasks:
- Standardize field names to match the expected schema
- Handle missing values (convert '-', 'None', empty strings, null to proper null)
- Ensure numeric fields (TotalCases, CasesConfirmed, Deaths, CFR) are properly typed as numbers or null
- Format dates consistently as YYYY-MM-DD strings
- Preserve narrative text and page numbers
- Remove any malformed or incomplete records

Expected JSON schema for EACH record:
{{
    "Country": "string",
    "Event": "string (disease name)",
    "Grade": "string (e.g., Grade 3, Grade 2, Ungraded)",
    "DateNotified": "string (date format YYYY-MM-DD)",
    "StartReportingPeriod": "string (date format YYYY-MM-DD)",
    "EndReportingPeriod": "string (date format YYYY-MM-DD)", 
    "TotalCases": "number or null",
    "CasesConfirmed": "number or null", 
    "Deaths": "number or null",
    "CFR": "number or null (decimal format)",
    "PageNumber": "number (page where record was found)",
    "NarrativeText": "string or null"
}}

Return format: [{{record1}}, {{record2}}, {{record3}}, ...]

Important: Return ONLY the JSON array, no additional text or explanations.
