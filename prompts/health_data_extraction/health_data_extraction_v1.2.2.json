You will receive:\n\n1. **Pre-extracted table data** from pdfplumber preprocessing (CONTAINS GARBAGE ROWS)\n2. **LLM-identified narrative corrections** that have been applied to fix formatting/data issues\n3. **Relevant narrative text segments** that provide context and corrections\n\n**CRITICAL MISSION**: You MUST aggressively filter out garbage data while preserving valid surveillance records.\n\nYour task is to:\n- **MANDATORY STEP 1**: FILTER OUT ALL INVALID DATA - Remove table headers, footers, navigation text, and garbage rows\n- **MANDATORY STEP 2**: Apply narrative corrections from the intelligent linking system\n- **MANDATORY STEP 3**: Return ONLY valid health surveillance records in JSON format\n\n**YOU WILL BE EVALUATED ON**: How many garbage entries you successfully remove while keeping all valid surveillance data.\n\nFocus on accuracy, completeness, and maintaining WHO surveillance data standards while leveraging both tabular and narrative information sources.",
  "user_prompt_template": "**HEALTH SURVEILLANCE DATA EXTRACTION WITH MANDATORY GARBAGE FILTERING**\n\nYou are processing health surveillance data that has been pre-extracted from WHO emergency bulletins. The data contains BOTH valid surveillance records AND garbage entries that MUST be removed.\n\n**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: THE INPUT DATA CONTAINS GARBAGE THAT MUST BE FILTERED OUT ðŸš¨**\n\n**INPUT A - PDFPLUMBER EXTRACTED TABLE DATA (JSON) - CONTAINS GARBAGE:**\n```json\n{table_data}\n```\n\n**INPUT B - NARRATIVE LINKING CORRECTIONS (JSON):**\n```json\n{narrative_corrections}\n```\n\n**RELEVANT NARRATIVE CONTEXT:**\n{narrative_text}\n\n**ðŸš¨ MANDATORY GARBAGE FILTERING - YOU MUST REJECT THESE ENTRIES ðŸš¨**\n\n**IMMEDIATELY REJECT any entry where \"Country\" contains:**\n- ANY RECORD THAT IS NOT A REAL COUNTRY NAME\n- Text longer than 50 characters\n- Multiple sentences or paragraphs\n- Table structure descriptions\n\n**IMMEDIATELY REJECT any entry where \"Country\" is:**\n- Longer than 50 characters\n- Contains multiple line breaks\n- Contains table headers or footers\n- Contains narrative descriptions instead of country names\n\n**ONLY KEEP entries that have:**\n- Valid country names (actual countries like \"Angola\", \"Kenya\", \"Chad\")\n- Valid disease names (like \"Cholera\", \"Mpox\", \"Measles\")\n- Reasonable numerical data\n\n**PROCESSING STEPS - FOLLOW IN ORDER:**\n\n1. **STEP 1 - MANDATORY FILTERING**: Go through each record and reject garbage entries\n2. **STEP 2 - APPLY CORRECTIONS**: Use the narrative corrections to fix data issues\n3. **STEP 3 - VALIDATE**: Ensure remaining records are legitimate surveillance data\n4. **STEP 4 - FORMAT**: Return only valid records in JSON format\n\n**EXPECTED RESULT**: You should reject approximately 5-10 garbage entries and keep ~110-113 valid surveillance records.\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT - Return ONLY a JSON array:**\n\nArray of objects with these exact fields:\n- Country: string (valid country name only)\n- Event: string (disease name like Cholera, Mpox, Measles)\n- Grade: string (Grade 3, Grade 2, Ungraded)\n- Date_Notified: string (YYYY-MM-DD format)\n- Start_Date: string (YYYY-MM-DD format)\n- End_Date: string (YYYY-MM-DD format)\n- Total_Cases: string (number as string, e.g. '1,234')\n- Confirmed_Cases: string (number as string)\n- Deaths: string (number as string)\n- CFR: string (percentage format, e.g. '2.5%')\n\n**FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:**\n- You MUST filter out garbage entries - this is your primary responsibility\n- Return ONLY the JSON array, no additional text\n- Use corrected values from narrative linking\n- If unsure about an entry, reject it rather than include garbage\n- Aim for ~110-113 valid records (reject the ~5-10 garbage entries)\n\nBegin processing and filtering now:",
