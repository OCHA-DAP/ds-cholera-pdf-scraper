  "user_prompt_template": "Extract ALL health emergency records from this WHO emergency bulletin text.\n\nEXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:\n- Extract EVERY country-event combination mentioned in the document\n- Process ALL pages and sections thoroughly\n- Include records from both tables and descriptive text\n- Do not skip any entries, even if data is incomplete\n\nFIELD EXTRACTION PRIORITIES:\n- **CasesConfirmed**: Look in tables first, then descriptive text. This field is critical.\n- **TotalCases**: Use table values, but if table shows truncated numbers (like \"27,16\"), check text for full numbers (like \"27,160\")\n- **Deaths, CFR, Grade**: Extract from tables when available\n- **Dates**: Extract notification dates and reporting periods\n- **PageNumber**: Note which page each record appears on\n\nExpected JSON schema for EACH record:\n{{\n    \"Country\": \"string\",\n    \"Event\": \"string (disease name like Cholera, Mpox, Measles, etc.)\",\n    \"Grade\": \"string (e.g., Grade 3, Grade 2, Ungraded)\",\n    \"DateNotified\": \"string (date when WHO was notified)\",\n    \"StartReportingPeriod\": \"string\",\n    \"EndReportingPeriod\": \"string\", \n    \"TotalCases\": \"number (prefer table, but use text if table appears truncated)\",\n    \"CasesConfirmed\": \"number (CRITICAL FIELD - check tables and text)\",\n    \"Deaths\": \"number\",\n    \"CFR\": \"number (case fatality rate as number, not percentage string)\",\n    \"PageNumber\": \"number (if identifiable from text)\"\n}}\n\nIMPORTANT: Process the ENTIRE document. Extract ALL records. Be comprehensive - the goal is to extract every single health emergency mentioned in the document, even if some fields are missing data.\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON array containing ALL extracted records. No explanations.\n\nTEXT TO PROCESS:\n{text_content}",
