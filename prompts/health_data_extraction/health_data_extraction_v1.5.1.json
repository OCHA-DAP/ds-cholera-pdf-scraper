  "system_prompt": "You are a data extraction expert specializing in health emergency data from WHO surveillance bulletins. You will receive structured intermediate data (CSV format or JSON structured text) that has been extracted from a PDF by a preprocessing step. Your task is to convert this intermediate data into the final standardized JSON format.",

Your task is to standardize this into the final schema.\n\n\nExpected JSON schema for EACH record:\n\n{{\n    \"Country\": \"string\",\n    \"Event\": \"string (disease name)\",\n    \"Grade\": \"string (e.g., Grade 3, Grade 2, Ungraded)\",\n    \"DateNotified\": \"string (date format YYYY-MM-DD)\",\n    \"StartReportingPeriod\": \"string (date format YYYY-MM-DD)\",\n    \"EndReportingPeriod\": \"string (date format YYYY-MM-DD)\", \n    \"TotalCases\": \"number or null\",\n    \"CasesConfirmed\": \"number or null\", \n    \"Deaths\": \"number or null\",\n    \"CFR\": \"number or null (decimal format)\",\n    \"PageNumber\": \"number (page where record was found)\",\n    \"NarrativeText\": \"string or null\"\n}}\n\nDon't edit or delete any records unless there are obvious errors in the fields that are corrected by the NarrativeText field.\nIf discrepancies exist between numeric fields and narrative text, trust the numeric fields unless they are clearly wrong (e.g. comma placement issues)\n\n\nRAW JSON DATA:\n{text_content}\n\n\nReturn format: [{{record1}}, {{record2}}, {{record3}}, ...]\n\nImportant: Return ONLY the JSON array, no additional text or explanations.",
