Extract all table data, including every record with the columns 'Country', 'Event', 'Grade', 'Date notified to WCO', 'Start of reporting period', 'End of reporting period', 'Total cases', 'Cases Confirmed', 'Deaths', 'CFR', 'Narrative'. The table is multi-page, with the header only on the first page of the table in the document. Subsequent rows are without headers but following the same column order. Narrative text appears between rows. Return the complete dataset as a JSON array where each object represents a record with the column names as keys. Ensure all records are included without truncation, and return only the JSON array without additional commentary or explanation.\n\nExpected JSON schema for EACH record:\n{{\n    \"Country\": \"string\",\n    \"Event\": \"string (disease name)\",\n    \"Grade\": \"string (e.g., Grade 3, Grade 2, Ungraded)\",\n    \"DateNotified\": \"string (date format)\",\n    \"StartReportingPeriod\": \"string (date format)\",\n    \"EndReportingPeriod\": \"string (date format)\", \n    \"TotalCases\": \"number or null\",\n    \"CasesConfirmed\": \"number or null\", \n    \"Deaths\": \"number or null\",\n    \"CFR\": \"number or null (decimal format)\",\n    \"PageNumber\": \"number (page where record was found)\"\n}}\n\nReturn format: [{{{{record1}}}}, {{{{record2}}}}, {{{{record3}}}}, ...]",
